# todolist-v2

<br />

This new project is inspired by my previous project [todolist-webapp-project](https://w3althambition.github.io/todolist-webapp-project/) which was loosely based on the [todoist](https://todoist.com) website which I love so much!

This version received a lot of improvements compared to the last, and it's a build up straight from my [last project](https://github.com/w3althambition/world-clock) where I had difficulties processing the array data. Now it's an all done in a few functions which use fewer lines of code compared to having functions nearly half a screen long! Now I simply utilized: map, filter and destructuring function properly. It all looks pretty neat!

Another improvement was how I used components, I am getting more comfortable using them. I've tried several ways of implementing them and I even got some inspiration from my first [react project](https://github.com/w3althambition/react-todo-app). Having fixed my previous weaknesses some new once were revealed. In the future, I will have to explore different ways of access the data across different components - maybe research how to properly utilize getters and setters in my setup. For example, now the project stores the data in the app manager component however the task manager needs that exact data too, so I have to push it around to both of them and keep it in sync, this can get really confusing.

Overall I am really happy with how this project turned out. It looks good, it functioning goods. A side note, I haven't used any style or functionality designs for this project, it's all freestyled based on my imagination. But look at it! I've come a long way since I first started, but I have a lot more to improve on to make my projects word-class and I am really excited to continue on this journey!
