# todolist-v2

This project is inspired by my previous project [todolist-webapp-project](https://w3althambition.github.io/todolist-webapp-project/) which was loosely based on the [todoist](https://todoist.com) website which I love very much!

This version received a lot of improvements, and it's a build up straight from my [last project](https://github.com/w3althambition/world-clock) where I had difficulties processing the array data. Now it's all done in a few elegant functions which use fewer lines of code. I simply have utilized: map, filter and restructuring function properly. It all looks pretty neat!

Another improvement was how I used components, I am getting more comfortable using them. I've tried several ways of implementing them and I even got some inspiration from my first [react project](https://github.com/w3althambition/react-todo-app). Having fixed my previous weaknesses, some new once were revealed. In the future, I will explore different ways of access the array data across different components - probably research and test how to properly utilize getters and setters methods in my setup. For example, project stores it's data in the app manager component, however, the task manager needs that exact data too, so I have to push it around to both of them and keep it in sync, this can get really annoying and confusing.

I am really happy with how this project turned out. It looks good, it is functioning great. A side note, I haven't used any style or functionality designs for this project, it's all freestyled based on my imagination. In the future, I plan to start using both. It will save tons of time if I start to think about how I will structure my code modules before doing them. Overall, I've come a long way since I first started, but I have a lot more to improve on to make my projects word-class, and I am really excited to continue on this journey!
