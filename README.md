# todolist-v2

<br />

This new project is based on my previous project [todolist-webapp-project](https://w3althambition.github.io/todolist-webapp-project/) which was loosely based on the [todoist](https://todoist.com) website which I love so much!

This version received a lot of improvements compared to the last at it's a build up straight from my last project where I had difficulties processing the array data. Now it's an all done in a few functions which use lines of code compared to my last project of having functions nearly half a screen long! Now I simply utilized: map, filter and destructuring function. It looks pretty good and it's a great set up.

Another improvement was the use of components, I am getting more comfortable using components. I've tried several ways of implementing and I even got some inspiration from my first [react project](https://github.com/w3althambition/react-todo-app) which was based on the tutorial. Having fixed my previous weaknesses more were revealed. In the future, I will have to explore different ways of access the data across different components. For example, now you store the data in the app manager component however the task manager needs that exact that, so I have to push it around both of them and keep it in sync, this can get really confusing especially for a programmer who doesn't know how all of this works.

Overall I am really happy with how this project turned out. It looks good, it functioning goods and my opinion it's a nice mid-level portfolio project. A side note, I haven't used any style or functionality designs for this project, it's all freestyled based on my imagination. Look at it, I've come a long way since I first started, but I have a lot more to improve on to make my projects word-class and I am really excited to continue on this journey!
